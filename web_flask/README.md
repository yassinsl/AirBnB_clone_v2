- Task 7:
    -Before using Flask to display our HBNB data, you will need to update some part of our engine:
    - Update FileStorage: (models/engine/file_storage.py)
        - Add a public method def close(self):: call reload() method for deserializing the JSON file to objects
    - Update DBStorage: (models/engine/db_storage.py)
        - Add a public method def close(self):: call remove() method on the private session attribute (self.__session) tips or close() on the class Session tips
    - Update State: (models/state.py) - If it’s not already present
    - If your storage engine is not DBStorage, add a public getter method cities to return the list of City objects from storage linked to the current State
